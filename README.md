## What is a network visualisation?

A network visualisation is a method used to display relationships between different connected entities, in an easy-to-read visual manner.

The graph below is an interactive graphical representation of the EMERGENCE network.

In this case each member of the network is an individual entity, represented on the graph as a node, or a small labelled circle.

A connection or relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge, or a straight line between two nodes.

Each member of the network is represented as an individual node on the graph colour coded based on their professional/research area of interest.
