# What is a network visualisation?

A network visualisation is a method used to display relationships between different connected entities, in an easy-to-read visual manner.

The graph below is an interactive graphical representation of the EMERGENCE network.

In this case each member of the network is an individual entity, represented on the graph as a node, or a small labelled circle.

A connection or relationship between two nodes is represented as an edge, or a straight line between two nodes.

Each member of the network is represented as an individual node on the graph colour coded based on their professional/research area of interest.

COMPUTER SCIENTISTS are coloured in RED. 

ROBOTICISTS. are coloured in BLUE

HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS are coloured in YELLOW

DESIGN ENGINEERING AND INNOVATION SPECIALISTS are coloured in GREEN

ELECTRONIC ENGINEERS are coloured in MAGENTA

SOCIAL CARE WORKERS are coloured in PURPLE

PHYSIOTHERAPISTS are coloured in ORANGE

## Why use a network visualisation?

In the context of the EMERGENCE network, a network visualisation is extremely useful in helping members of the network find each other, for example, a researcher may want to find someone in a different field to help them with a robotics project to aid those with frailty, or an end-user wanting to see if one of their friends recently joined the network, this tool can be used in many different contexts for many different types of users to achieve different goals.

Network visualisations are also helpful in presenting large quantities of data in an easy-to-understand and read manner, the addition of a visual and interactive elements to the presentation of the data streamline the process of searching, and help demonstrate the scale of the EMERGENCE network.

The tool also allows users to filter members based on different attributes such as institution, specialty, location etc. which allows members to quickly find the person they need without excessive searching.

## How do I use the network visualisation tool?

The network visualisation tool is simple and easy to use and has a few main features: 

Legend: Can be referenced to find the unique colour coding for each specialty. 

Node/Member Hovering: Hover over each node to reveal further information about the member represented, i.e. name, institution, job title, specialty, location, and research theme of interest.

Node Filtering: Allows the user to filter to find a specific category of node, for example a member who specialises in computer science, or a member who is based in London.

Node Physics: Each node on the graph is fully interactive, you can drag the nodes with your mouse, if the node is connected to another with an edge both nodes will move. 

Steps to filter nodes:

Under the 'Select a network item' dropdown select the 'node' option

Under the 'Select a property' dropdown select the property to filter by i.e. Institution

Under the 'Select value(s)' dropdown select the actual value of the property you selected in step 2, i.e. 'University of Nottingham'

The 'include-central-node' option is used to allow the central node to appear alongside the filtered nodes, toggle this on if you want to see the connected graph with the filtered nodes, or off if you just want to see the filtered nodes. 

The 'include-legend-nodes' option is used to allow the legend nodes to appear alongside the filtered nodes, toggle this on if you want to see the legend with the filtered nodes, or off if you just want to see the filtered nodes. 

Click the 'Filter' button to the right of the 'Select value(s)' dropdown to apply the selected filter.

Press the 'Reset Selection' button to the right of the 'Filter' button to undo the filter.
